                <p class="text">Halo Wars 2 is a real-time strategy game that is being produced as a collaboration between Creative Assembly and Microsoft. The game is a sequel to the original Halo Wars and will be done in the same style of its predecessor. The game was announced early in 2015 but so far, neither company is able to say exactly when the game will be made available but it is expected to be launched during the Holiday season of 2016. When it finally is completed it will be available as a console exclusive on the Xbox One but will also be offered as part of Windows 10 on Windows PCs. The game had an official reveal trailer at Gamescom 2015 with the promise of more information coming early in 2016.
                    The Spirit of Fire's crew awakens from cryosleep at the Ark and receives a UNSC signal from the surface of the installation. Spartan Red Team is deployed to investigate the signal. They recover Isabel from a base but during the exfiltration, Spartan Douglas-042 is injured in an engagement with Atriox and Spartan Alice-130 is left stranded on the Ark. Back on the Spirit of Fire, Isabel reveals to Captain Cutter how Atriox and the Banished invaded the Ark, which leads Cutter to declare war on the Banished. A strike team manages to set up a forward base and defeat Decimus, who is salvaging the Arkâ€™s resources. Decimus escapes and orders a bombardment upon his own base. Upon investigating the wreckage, Isabel discovers information about the Cartographer, a map of key systems and weapons upon the Ark. The team secures a Forerunner elevator and ascends to the Cartographer.

                <h1 class="title">Gameplay</h1>
                <p class="text">Halo Wars 2 is a military science-fiction real-time strategy video game, in which players command armies from a bird's-eye view of the battlefield.[1][2] The game can be played using a gamepad or using a mouse and keyboard.[2] Like its predecessor Halo Wars, the game features two playable factions: humanity's main military arm, the United Nations Space Command (UNSC), who return from the first game, and a new alien faction known as the Banished, who serve as replacement for the Covenant.[3][4] A story-based campaign mode lets players take control of UNSC forces in battles against the Banished on an ancient structure.[1][3] The campaign consists of twelve missions that can be played alone or cooperatively.[2][5] Each mission presents main objectives that involve capturing points, defending bases, or surviving waves of enemies,[1] and often require the player to lead Spartan supersoldier units around the map. The campaign also features optional side objectives such as ensuring a certain unit survives over the course of a mission or destroying extra bases within a time limit.[2] Animated cutscenes and dialogue precede each mission to provide context and integration with the game's story.[1]</p>

                <h1 class="title">Multiplayer</h1>
                <p class="text">Halo Wars 2 features a number of multiplayer modes that can be played online with up to six players.[9] Skirmish is a cooperative or solo play mode against AI opponents.[10] Deathmatch involves eliminating the opponent's army.[9] Stronghold and Domination are territorial modes centered around controlling bases or nodes on the map.[2] Blitz is a mode that combines elements from collectible card games with RTS gameplay by replacing the base building and resource management with a card-and-deck mechanic for unit deployment.[11][12] Players create decks from card packs that are earned by playing the campaign mode and completing daily challenges. Each card features a unit that is deployed on the battlefield.[11] Energy is the resource for using cards; more powerful units have a higher energy cost. Energy generates automatically throughout a match and more can be collected as additional energy supplies are dropped onto the map periodically.[10] There is single-player and cooperative variant of Blitz named Firefight, which pits players against waves of AI enemies.[2]
