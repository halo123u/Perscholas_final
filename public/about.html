                <p class="text">Halo 5: Guardians takes place in the year 2558, and is set eight months after the events of Halo 4. The game follows the human fireteams Blue Team and Fireteam Osiris.[7] Blue Team is led by Master Chief Petty Officer John-117 (Steve Downes) and is composed of the Spartan-II teammates he fought alongside in the timeframe before Halo: Combat Evolved:[8] Linda-058 (Brittany Uomoleale), an elite sniper; Kelly-087 (Michelle Lukes), a scout known for her incredible speed and John's closest friend; and Frederic-104 (Travis Willingham), who is technically Blue Team's highest-ranking officer, but defers to Master Chief.[9] The members of Blue Team are all Spartan-IIs, augmented super soldiers who were abducted and trained as children; they are among the last Spartan-IIs left alive.[10] Fireteam Osiris comprises Spartan-IVs, a newer generation of Spartans who joined the program as adult members of the military. 
                    Fireteam Osiris is led by Jameson Locke (Ike Amadi),
                    a former agent of the Office of Naval Intelligence (ONI) and skilled tracker. 
                    The other members of Fireteam Osiris are: Holly Tanaka (Cynthia McWilliams),
                    a survivor of a Covenant attack on her world; Olympia Vale (Laura Bailey),
                    who can speak many of the Covenant's dialects; and Edward Buck (Nathan Fillion),
                    a veteran former Orbital Drop Shock Trooper who was previously a main character in Halo 3: ODST.

                <h1 class="title">Warzone</h1>
                <p class="text">Warzone is a 24-player multiplayer mode in Halo 5: Guardians.
                     It features two teams of 12 players each, AI-controlled opponents, and maps 
                     up to four times larger than any previous Halo multiplayer map. 
                    Commander Sarah Palmer acts as the announcer for Warzone.
                    </br>
                    </br>
                    There are three gametypes in Warzone.
                     The first is the core gametype, which features AI-controlled opponents and a 
                     home base for each team, as well as three bases to fight over. The second gametype 
                     does not have AI opponents and features one attacking team tasked with capturing two 
                     bases, before proceeding to destroy the enemy team's core.[6] The final gametype, 
                     Warzone Firefight, tasks a team of 8 players with completing an objective each round 
                     for 5 rounds, against AI opponents. If they fail to complete an objective, the match 
                     will end with a loss.If they succeed in completing all five, the game will end in victory.

                <h1 class="title">Arena</h1>
                <p class="text">Arena is classic Halo at its finest: 4v4, with well-designed
                     maps that donâ€™t heavily favor one strategy over another, and a broad variety of modes like Slayer, CTF, and the fan-favorite fast-kill mode, SWAT. Its slew of maps and cosmetic armor customization options is impressive,
                     and the addition of visible timers above power weapon spots creates
                      exciting clashes like clockwork.</p>
